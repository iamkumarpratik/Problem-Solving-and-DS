# Time complexity.

# Time taken to run a particular algorithm. Depending on the time complexity;
# it is assesed how efficient or fast an algorithm is to solve a problem.

# Notation: Big O.

# Ex: O(1), O(N), O(N^2), and O(log n).

# Time complexity: O(N^2) > O(N) > O(log n)> O(1).

# Space Complexity.

# Total space taken by the algorithm data with comparasion to the input size.
